# Exercise Implementations for the Lecture Web and Multimedia Engineering

For the lecture Web and Multimedia Engineering, I solved four different exercises in JavaScript, PHP, CSS and HTML together with a friend back in 2015.

The exercises included the construction of a REST interface, of a responsive design, the implementation of a CSV to JSON converter (Task 3) and dynamic table content generation using PHP (Task 2).
